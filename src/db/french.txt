In French, lit. a 'coat-carrier', originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train, now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger.

However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be \"a bed & breakfast\" or \"B&B.\" The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'h\u00f4te (literally \"table of the house\" or \"table of the host\"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled \"table d'h\u00f4te\" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a \"bed & breakfast -style\" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, table d'h\u00f4te generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression couette et caf\u00e9 (lit. \"duvet and coffee\") is generally used to talk about B&B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.\n", "translation": "tableau vivant (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as tableau)\n"}, {"phrase": "in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture.
